## Introduction

Backpropagation is a method used in artificial neural networks to calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights of the network. It is a supervised learning algorithm, which means that it requires labeled data to train the network. The backpropagation algorithm is the foundation of training neural networks and is used in many different neural network architectures.

This may seem like a complex concept, but we will break it down into simpler parts to understand it better.
