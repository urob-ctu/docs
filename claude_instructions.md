Excellent. These sections on training are the heart of the matter. Getting these right is crucial for students to understand how models go from being inert collections of parameters to functional tools.

Let's proceed with the same format.

### `training.md`

This is the index page for the "Training" section.

#### General Feedback

* This page sets the stage well. The list of topics is logical.
* The introductory sentence is good. The final sentence, "Understanding these concepts is crucial...", is also strong. You could perhaps make it even more compelling by connecting it to practical outcomes.

**Suggestion:**
> "Understanding these concepts is crucial for training any machine learning model effectively. When a model fails to learn, the problem often lies not in the model's architecture, but in the training process itself. Mastering these fundamentals will give you the tools to diagnose and solve these issues."

### `loss-functions.md`

This page provides a deep, theoretical grounding for loss functions, starting from KL Divergence.

#### General Feedback

* This is an exceptionally strong and theoretically sound page. The derivation of Cross-Entropy from KL Divergence is something many courses skip, and its inclusion here is a huge benefit for students seeking a deep understanding.
* The coin-flipping example to build intuition for KL Divergence is brilliant.
* The connection to Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) is also explained very clearly.
* One minor point of clarification could be to explicitly name the transition from the expectation over the true distribution $$p^*$$ to the average over the dataset $$\mathcal{D}$$ as a **Monte Carlo approximation**. This gives a formal name to a critical step.

**Suggestion:** When you show the approximation:
`$$ \approx \arg\min_{\boldsymbol{w}} \Bigl( \frac{1}{N} \sum_{(\boldsymbol{x}, y) \sim \mathcal{D}} -\log p(y \,\vert\, \boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{w}) \Bigr) $$`
You could add a note:
> This step is where theory meets practice. Since we cannot compute the true expectation over the unknown distribution $$p^*$$, we approximate it with an average over the dataset $$\mathcal{D}$$, which is a sample from $$p^*$$. This is a form of **Monte Carlo estimation**.

#### Improved "Expected Knowledge" Section

The concepts here are abstract, so the questions should test the student's ability to connect these abstract ideas to their practical application.

### Expected Knowledge

Answer the following questions to test your understanding of the theoretical basis for loss functions.

1. **KL Divergence vs. Cross-Entropy:** In training, our goal is to make our model's distribution $$p$$ as close as possible to the true data distribution $$p^*$$. While KL Divergence ($$D_{\text{KL}}(p^* || p)$$) directly measures this, in practice we minimize the Cross-Entropy Loss ($$H(p^*, p)$$). Based on the derivation, explain *why* minimizing cross-entropy is equivalent to minimizing KL divergence. What term from the KL divergence formula can we ignore during optimization and why?

2. **The Role of Softmax:** The cross-entropy loss function requires a probability distribution as input from our model. What specific function do we use to convert the raw `logits` from a neural network into a valid probability distribution? Describe one key property of this function's output. [geeksforgeeks.org](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-are-logits-what-is-the-difference-between-softmax-and-softmax-cross-entropy-with-logits/)

3. **Intuition and Application:** What is the relationship between minimizing cross-entropy loss and the principle of Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)? Explain it conceptually. If you were building a classifier from scratch, what principle does this connection justify about your choice of loss function?

4. **KL Divergence Asymmetry:** KL Divergence is not a true "distance" metric because it is asymmetric, i.e., $$D_{\text{KL}}(p || q) \neq D_{\text{KL}}(q || p)$$. What does the value $$D_{\text{KL}}(p || q)$$ intuitively represent, in terms of information or "surprise," as noted by sources like Medium?

### `gradient-descent.md`

This page introduces the core optimization algorithm.

#### General Feedback

* This is a good, high-level introduction to the training loop and gradient descent. The GIF is very effective.
* The page defines vanilla "Gradient Descent," which computes the gradient over the entire dataset. However, its motivation—training models like GPT—refers to training on massive datasets where this is infeasible. It is critical to introduce **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** and **Mini-batch Gradient Descent** here, as they are the variants used in almost all modern deep learning.

**Suggestion:** Add a section on variants of Gradient Descent.

> ### Variants of Gradient Descent
>
> While the formula above describes "Batch Gradient Descent" (where the loss is calculated over the entire training set), this is computationally infeasible for large datasets common in robotics (e.g., millions of camera frames). In practice, we use variants:
>
> * **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):** The gradient is calculated and parameters are updated for *each training sample* individually. This is much faster per update but the updates can be very noisy.
> * **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent:** This is a compromise. The gradient is calculated and updates are performed on small, random batches of data (e.g., 32 or 64 samples at a time). This is the standard approach in deep learning, as it balances computational efficiency with the stability of the gradient estimate.

* The role of the **learning rate** ($$\alpha$$) can be elaborated on. It's the single most important hyperparameter in training.

#### Improved "Expected Knowledge" Section

The questions should focus on the mechanics of the algorithm and its practical considerations.

`---`

### Expected Knowledge

Answer the following questions to test your understanding of the gradient descent algorithm.

1. **The Role of the Learning Rate:** In the gradient descent update rule, what is the purpose of the learning rate $$\alpha$$? Describe what is likely to happen during training if you set the learning rate (a) too high, and (b) too low.

2. **The Training Loop:** Describe the sequence of steps for **one** iteration of mini-batch gradient descent. Start with a mini-batch of data and end with the updated model parameters. Clearly define the role of the "forward pass" and "backward pass" in this process.

3. **Gradient Descent Variants:** What is the fundamental difference between Batch Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)? Why is Mini-Batch Gradient Descent the most commonly used variant for training large neural networks?

### `backpropagation.md`

This page explains the mechanism for computing gradients.

#### General Feedback

* This is a solid explanation. The use of computation graphs is the correct and most intuitive way to teach backpropagation.
* The concrete numerical example, with forward, backward, and update steps shown on the graph, is excellent for demystifying the process.
* The VJP section is great for bridging the gap to how modern libraries work. To improve it, you could add one sentence explaining *why* it's so important: it avoids the need to explicitly construct a massive, memory-intensive Jacobian matrix.

**Suggestion:** In the VJP section, add:
> The primary advantage of the VJP approach is its efficiency. For a function mapping $$\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$$, the full Jacobian matrix has $$m \times n$$ elements. For a deep neural network, this is an enormous matrix that would be impossible to store in memory. The VJP calculates the required gradient contribution without ever forming this full matrix.

* You can strengthen the intuition by framing backpropagation as a system for assigning "blame."

**Suggestion:** Add to the introduction:
> Conceptually, backpropagation is an algorithm for assigning "blame" or "responsibility" for the final loss to every parameter in the network. It starts with the total error at the end and works backward, using the chain rule to calculate how much each weight contributed to that error.

#### Improved "Expected Knowledge" Section

The questions should test both the high-level concept and the underlying mechanics.

`---`

### Expected Knowledge

Answer the following questions to test your understanding of backpropagation.

1. **Conceptual Understanding:** Explain backpropagation in non-mathematical terms. What is a "computation graph," and how does backpropagation use it to compute gradients?

2. **The Chain Rule:** Imagine a simple computation: $$z = w \cdot x + b$$, followed by $$a = \text{ReLU}(z)$$, and a loss $$L = (a_{true} - a)^2$$. Using the chain rule, write down the expression for the partial derivative of the loss with respect to the weight, $$\frac{\partial L}{\partial w}$$.

3. **Vector-Jacobian Product (VJP):** What is the main practical advantage of using the Vector-Jacobian Product (VJP) to implement backpropagation in deep learning libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow, compared to explicitly calculating the entire Jacobian matrix?

4. **Forward vs. Backward Pass:** What key quantity is computed during the **forward pass**? What key quantity is computed for each parameter during the **backward pass**? How do these two passes work together in the context of gradient descent?
