# Machine Learning Fundamentals
{: .no_toc }

This section covers the core concepts that form the foundation of machine learning in robotics. Before we can teach a robot to see, act, or predict, we must first understand how to represent its world as data, how to frame learning as a specific task, and how to rigorously measure success. Mastering these fundamentals is essential for building robust and intelligent systems.

## What You'll Learn

- **[Datasets and Features]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/fundamentals/datasets-features.md %})** - How data is structured and represented in machine learning
- **[Classification]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/fundamentals/classification.md %})** - Predicting discrete class labels from features
- **[Regression]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/fundamentals/regression.md %})** - Predicting continuous values from features
- **[Classification Metrics]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/fundamentals/evaluation-metrics.md %})** - How to measure classification model performance

These concepts apply across all machine learning models and are essential for understanding more advanced topics.
