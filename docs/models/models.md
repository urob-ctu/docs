# Machine Learning Models
{: .no_toc }

This section covers different types of machine learning models, from simple similarity-based approaches to complex neural networks.

## What You'll Learn

- **[k-Nearest Neighbors]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/models/knn.md %})** - A simple, intuitive classifier based on similarity
- **[Linear Classifiers]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/models/linear-classifiers.md %})** - Efficient models using linear decision boundaries
- **[Neural Networks]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/models/neural-networks.md %})** - Multi-layer perceptrons for complex pattern recognition
- **[Convolutional Networks]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/models/convolutional-networks.md %})** - Specialized architectures for structured data like images

Each model we explore has different strengths, computational requirements, and ideal use cases. A key skill you will develop is understanding these trade-offs, which will allow you to select the right approach for a given robotics problem.
