# Robot Learning Course
{: .no_toc }

## Welcome to B3B33UROB

This course introduces fundamental and advanced concepts in machine learning with a focus on robotics applications. You'll learn how robots can learn from data to perform complex tasks, from basic classification and regression to deep neural networks and reinforcement learning.

## Course Overview

**Robot Learning** bridges the gap between traditional robotics and modern machine learning techniques. In this course, you will:

- Master the fundamentals of supervised learning (classification and regression)
- Understand how neural networks work from the ground up
- Learn to train models using gradient descent and backpropagation
- Explore convolutional neural networks for vision tasks
- Dive into reinforcement learning for robot control
- Apply these techniques to real robotics problems

## Course Structure

The course content is organized into the following main sections:

### ðŸ“š [Fundamentals]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/fundamentals/fundamentals.md %})
Start here to understand the basic building blocks of machine learning:
- Datasets and Features
- Classification and Regression
- Evaluation Metrics

### ðŸ¤– [Models]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/models/models.md %})
Explore different types of machine learning models:
- k-Nearest Neighbors
- Linear Classifiers
- Neural Networks (MLPs)
- Convolutional Networks

### ðŸŽ¯ [Training]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/training/training.md %})
Learn how models learn from data:
- Loss Functions
- Gradient Descent
- Backpropagation

## Prerequisites

- Linear Algebra (matrix operations, vector spaces)
- Calculus (derivatives, chain rule)
- Basic Programming (Python recommended)
- Probability and Statistics (basic concepts)

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

1. **Understand** the mathematical foundations of machine learning
